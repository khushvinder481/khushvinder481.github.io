                There is immense physical ability and abundant skill available among our forest-dwelling brothers. 
                Of the various outreach activities carried out by the Kalyan Ashram, one of the most important tasks in the Sports dimension 
                is going to remote villages in search of talented sports persons and providing them opportunities by training them adequately.
            </p>

            <p>
                Vanavasi Kalyan Ashram has achieved many milestones after working dedicatedly in the field of sports for so many years, 
                owing to which the sports world has received many young players.
            </p>

            <p>
                Sports competitions are organized at national level once every four years. Competitions are also held at Tehsil (Block) level to District and State levels, 
                with participation from thousands to lakhs of forest-dwelling youth across the country. This ensures that talent flourishes by getting both training and opportunity to play. 
                Girls also actively showcase their skills at many venues.
            </p>

            <p>
                Every year, Vanavasi Kalyan Ashram organizes archery and other sports competitions at the national level. Daily or weekly sports centers are run to develop a sense of unity, camaraderie, and purpose among rural youth. 
                Youth workers are recruited through these Sports Centres to help in organizing and training young players.
