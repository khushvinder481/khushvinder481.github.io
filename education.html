                <p>
                    Education is the right of all children and there is a special need for education in remote tribal areas. 
                    Even today, due to fewer schools, janjaati children have to travel far away for education. 
                    Quality of education is another challenge amongst the limited number of available schools.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Along with the government, many social organizations are also working in various forms for education 
                    in the janjaati areas. Due to the ideas propounded by the British in our country, many people feel 
                    that education is a matter of governance. But in reality, Indian thought process says that it is the 
                    responsibility of the society that everyone should get good education easily.

                <p>
                    Ekal Vidyalaya is a project that will inspire not only any janjaati youth but also all social workers. 
                    In a village where Ekal Vidyalaya is operational, youngsters from the same village gather children 
                    studying of different grades for 3-4 hours every day in the courtyard of any house, or in a temple 
                    or under a tree, and along with formal education, try to inculcate Sanskar as well. 
                    At present more than 2000 such Ekal Vidyalaya are being operated by Kalyan Ashram.
